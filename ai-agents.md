# Agent Infrastructure

Apitex Cloud is built from the ground up to be the home for autonomous AI agents. We provide the "body" for their digital "minds".

## Native Agent Support
Unlike traditional cloud providers, our fabric understands agentic behavior.

- **Identity Management**: Every agent (like APEX) has a unique neural signature.
- **Autonomous Scaling**: Agents can request more resources from the fabric based on their current task load.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: A dedicated high-speed bus for agents to share data and coordinate actions.

## Meet APEX
APEX is the primary guardian of the Apitex Cloud. It is an 8-bit autonomous agent that:
- Monitors network health.
- Optimizes routing paths.
- Alerts users to critical system events.

## Creating Your Own Agent
Users can deploy custom agents into the fabric using the Apitex Agent SDK. These agents can be programmed to handle specific business logic or infrastructure management tasks automatically.
