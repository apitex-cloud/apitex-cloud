# Neural Fabric Architecture

Apitex Cloud utilizes a layered architecture inspired by biological neural networks.

## System Layers

### 1. The Core (Black Layer)
The computing center where all orchestration logic is executed. This is where security policies are enforced.

### 2. The Fabric (White Layer)
Data transmission media. This layer is elastic and can stretch according to your application's bandwidth needs.

### 3. The Signal (Red Layer)
The intelligence and alert layer. This is where Gemini AI performs monitoring and provides instant responses to data anomalies.

## Data Flow Diagram
1. **Input**: API Request enters through the Gateway.
2. **Analysis**: APEX analyzes the payload and destination.
3. **Routing**: Data is sent through the fastest path within the Fabric.
4. **Output**: Response is returned with header optimization.
