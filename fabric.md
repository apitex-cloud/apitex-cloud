# Scalable Fabric

The Apitex Cloud Fabric is an elastic, high-performance medium designed to handle the massive data requirements of modern AI applications.

## Elasticity by Design
The "White Layer" of our architecture allows for seamless scaling.

- **Neural Stretching**: As demand increases, the fabric dynamically allocates more "nerves" (bandwidth) to high-priority nodes.
- **Node Clustering**: Automatically group related services together to reduce latency.
- **Global Presence**: Your fabric can span multiple regions while appearing as a single, unified system.

## Performance
By utilizing 8-bit optimization protocols, we reduce header overhead significantly. This allows for more "payload" per packet, leading to higher throughput compared to traditional cloud infrastructures.

## Reliability
The fabric is designed to be self-healing. If a connection is severed, APEX will automatically reroute the signal through the next fastest available path in the neural network.
